# Supply Chain Analysis

This project is a data analysis of a supply chain dataset using Python and Plotly. It helps to uncover insights such as sales by product type, total revenue by shipping carrier, average lead time and manufacturing costs, and defect rates by product type and transportation mode.

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/samargunners/supply-chain-analysis.git

2. Change the working directory:
cd supply-chain-analysis

3. Create a virtual environment:
python3 -m venv venv

4. Activate the virtual environment:

- On macOS and Linux:

  ```
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

- On Windows:

  ```
  .\venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

5. Install the required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Now, the project is set up, and you can run the scripts or notebooks.

## Visualizations

Various visualizations are created using Plotly to help explore and analyze the data. The visualizations include:

- Pie charts to display sales by product type and cost distribution by transportation mode
- Bar charts to show sales, revenue, manufacturing costs, and defect rates by product type
- Line charts to visualize revenue and stock levels by SKU (Stock Keeping Unit)
- Bar charts to show order quantities by SKU and shipping costs by carrier

## Questions & Answers

Throughout the analysis, several key questions are addressed, such as:

- Which product types generate the most revenue and sales?
- How do different shipping carriers compare in terms of total revenue generated?
- What are the average lead times and manufacturing costs for each product type?
- How do stock levels and order quantities vary across different SKUs?
- What are the shipping costs associated with each carrier?
- How do defect rates vary by product type and transportation mode?

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the power of Python and Plotly for data analysis and visualization. By analyzing the supply chain dataset, valuable insights are uncovered that can help guide decision-making and optimize the supply chain process.
